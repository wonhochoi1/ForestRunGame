# ForestRunGame

## Made by Wonho Choi

Forest Run is a simple Game Boy Advance emulated  *Obstacle Dodging Game* to try to get the player to reach the door in the forest in order to escape it. You will be playing as a stressed emoji face, running to dodge the two main obstacles of an Alligator and a Tree that you can get caught in. 

You are first directed to an opening screen. Press ENTER to get started!

If you hit one of the obstacles, you lose the game and are sent to the end screen with a loss. The time limit is also 45 seconds, meaning that after the time passes, the game automatically goes to the losing page. 

You win the game by successfully reaching the door in the bottom right corner of the map without colliding with any obstacles. If you fail, or at any point of the game, you can restart a new attempt by pressing the DELETE key. 

The controls are the following
- RIGHT ARROW: Move your character to the right direction
- LEFT ARROW: Move your character to the left direction
- UP ARROW: Move your character upwards
- DOWN ARROW: Move your character downwards
- DELETE: Restart the game or go back to the beginning position fo the game.
